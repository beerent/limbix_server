# limbix_server

this is a server to an android application I made called "limbix". The name limbix comes from the limbic system. This server handles requests, and provides responses. The server accepts a single request, and provides a single response. All requests and responses are in json format.

This server is not currently running - it was great practice working on my favorite concept - client server communication. The server is pretty well developed - the android development was the main focus of this project for the last few months of its life. See my 'limbix_android' application for more information.

To get started with this code, check out the ConnectionHandler (https://github.com/beerent/limbix_server/blob/master/Remind%20Me/src/com/remindme/server/ConnectionHandler.java) class!
